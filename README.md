# 🧬 ChilSoft Theme

A glowing, neon-drenched Jekyll theme built for terminal nerds, hackers, home lab junkies, and caffeine-powered chaos engineers.

This theme is used on [ChilSoft.com](https://chilsoft.com) and exists mainly because I didn’t like the defaults and wanted something that looked like a code editor had a baby with a synthwave arcade.
